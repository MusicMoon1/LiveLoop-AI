These scripts should be run in a conda environment with the following requirements:

python 3.11 (important!)
basic-pitch
librosa
numpy

Install example:  
<code>
conda create -n genmus_bcn2024 python=3.11
pip install basic-pitch
pip install librosa
pip install numpy
</code>

Basic Pitch needs Tensorflow and Python 3.11 to install the correct dependencies.
