These scripts should be run in a conda environment with the following requirements:

1. python 3.11 (important!)  
2. basic-pitch  
3. librosa  
4. numpy  

Install example:  
<code>conda create -n genmus_bcn2024 python=3.11
pip install basic-pitch
pip install librosa
pip install numpy
</code>

Basic Pitch needs Tensorflow and Python 3.11 to install the correct dependencies.
